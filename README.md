# SOC Copilot â€” Wazuh Edition

An **AI-driven Security Operations Center (SOC) automation framework** that integrates Wazuh telemetry with MITRE ATT&CK mapping, transparent risk scoring, automated playbook retrieval, incident ticket drafting, sensor health analysis, and SOC analyst Q&A â€” delivering a complete, end-to-end triage workflow.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

**SOC Copilot â€” Wazuh Edition** is a **portfolio-grade cybersecurity automation system** designed to replicate and enhance the analytical workflows of modern SOC environments.  
It empowers **Tier-1 and Tier-2 SOC analysts** to rapidly ingest, analyze, and act upon security alerts, significantly reducing manual triage effort.

This implementation is built in **Python** and leverages **AI-assisted engineering** to achieve deterministic, reproducible results.

The repository includes **synthetic (non-production) data** for demonstration purposes, ensuring there is no exposure of proprietary or sensitive information.  

The architecture, however, is fully capable of operating with **real-world telemetry** in production SOC environments, with only minor configuration changes required to integrate with live data pipelines.

---

## ðŸ§  Why Use Synthetic Data

- **Security and Privacy**: Protects against accidental leakage of sensitive or proprietary incident details.  
- **Repeatable Demonstrations**: Synthetic datasets ensure consistent outputs for demos, documentation, and testing.  
- **Adaptability**: All processing logic is agnostic to whether input data is synthetic or live, meaning production deployment requires only pointing the ingestion service at the desired telemetry source.

---

## ðŸš€ Key Features

- **Multi-Source Telemetry Normalization**  
  Ingests alerts from **Wazuh** (primary), Zeek, AWS CloudTrail, and other supported sources, transforming them into a unified schema.

- **MITRE ATT&CK Technique Mapping**  
  Automatically maps observable indicators to tactics and techniques (e.g., `T1059.003 â€“ PowerShell`) with confidence scores and concise justifications.

- **Deterministic Risk Scoring**  
  Employs a transparent, fixed-weight scoring model considering base severity, asset criticality, technique risk, and spread indicators â€” with escalation rules for critical contexts.

- **Contextual Playbook Retrieval**  
  Matches mapped techniques and tags to relevant containment and eradication procedures.

- **Automated Incident Ticket Drafting**  
  Produces fully formatted Jira or ServiceNow tickets with MITRE mappings, IOC summaries, key evidence, recommended actions, and playbook references.

- **Sensor Health & Coverage Insights**  
  Reports endpoint coverage metrics by organizational unit (OU) or VPC and identifies blind spots.

- **Structured, Analyst-Ready Output**  
  Generates a consolidated JSON containing normalized alerts, triage results, incident summaries, sensor health metrics, and prioritized rankings.

### Risk Scoring Formula

```markdown
risk_score = (0.4 Ã— base_severity)
           + (0.3 Ã— criticality)
           + (0.2 Ã— technique_risk)
           + (0.1 Ã— spread_indicator)
```
#### Escalation Triggers:
- Domain Controller or Tier-0 assets
- Asset criticality â‰¥ 9
- Ransomware indicators (T1486)
- Sensor inactive within the last 24 hours
